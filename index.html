    <h2>an introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Emma. To my sister, I'm Emma Kate. To my father, I'm Em. I attend a liberal arts college in Lexington, Virginia. I study photography and journalism.</p>
      <p>My studies encourage me to look beyond, and to look deep. Photography forces me to see beyond the everyday and to notice light, color and movement. Because of photography, I am conscious of time and space. Journalism forces me to see deeply into the lives of my neighbors, leaders and friends. Because of journalism, I am conscious of people's stories.</p>
      <p>Who I am today is a culmination of Emma's gone. I am the product of their loves and joys, as well as their sadnesses and pains.</p>

    <h2>looking back</h2>
      <p>As an undergraduate student, I have felt overwhelming doubt, loss and misdirection. I knew I liked photography and journalism, but I was scared that my talents would never be enough for the world outside of Lexington. I worried constantly that I wouldn't get a job as a journalist when I graduated, or that I would never be hired as a portrait photographer.</p>
      <p>These worries and fears were exacerbated by the people I chose to spend my time with. The individual I dated for the majority of my undergraduate experience was manipulative and emotionally abusive. His unhealthy need to control my every step, and my unhealthy need to please the people I loved, made for diminished dreams. At his bidding, I quit sports I loved, abandonned friends I cherished and ran from job opportunities I wanted. I became someone else. I was no longer Emma. Not Emma Kate. Not Em.</p>
      <p>When the toxic relationship was terminated, I found myself more lost than ever before. I was starting from scratch. With my past dreams and interests thrown out the window, I scrambled to find new ones. I began the process of finding Emma again. I returned to the gym. I picked up my camera. I started writing. I am returning.</p>

    <h2>looking forward</h2>
      <p>I have since found my confidence again. My dreams, while not the same, are back and they are vivid. I regularly take self-portraits, putting myself in the spotlight, reminding myself that I am of worth, that my needs are important, that my talents and dreams and passions are legitimate.</p>
      <p>In the next five years, I trust my dreams will change yet again. I no longer want to write for National Geographic. I want to write for small town papers. I no longer want to photograph for National Geographic. I want to photograph the people closest to me, for the people closest to me. In five years, I trust that I will want to write and photograph with new intentions. But those intentions will be mine, and no one else's.</p>
      <p>My future will be dominated by self-discovery and examination. I will become the most "Emma" I can be. And she will be beautiful. And powerful. And strong. And intelligent. And talented. And worthy. And kind. That is all I need my next five years to be. I don't need to marry, or get that perfect post-grad job. I need to be myself. The dreams will follow.</p>
      <p>Here's to the next five years.</p>
