    <h2> About</h2>
      <p> I am a visual storyteller based in Lexington, Virginia, where I am studying journalism and photography at Washington & Lee University. </p>
      <p> My coursework is supported by reporting internships and a work-study position as a student campus photographer. Both journalism and photojournalism experiences have exposed me to a variety of people and events. I've covered everything from high school basketball games to local government ordinances. </p>
      <p> I enjoy documentary photography, but my heart also holds a special place for fine art. I have experience in both the darkroom and Adobe interfaces. My most recent projects investigate the manipulation of archival images. I also practice portraiture - for both people and pets. </p>
